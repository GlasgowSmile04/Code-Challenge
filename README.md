A hexadecimal guessing game for the masses
.
This is my game. The core gameplay features are all built, however I did not have time to meet all of my stretch goals. 
There is still some styling to do and all of the auxilary buttons need to be hookeed up. 
Eventually there will be local sotrage for the scores and users, and a high score board that displays the highest score. 
The info button will display a "how to play the game section". 

My code has not been refactored, there's a lot of things that are duplicated, I will eventually clean this up but
what you see is all I had time for in the weekend I had to code this project. 

Thank you,

Zac
